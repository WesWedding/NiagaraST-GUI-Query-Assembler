To participate in this: (swap in your username)

git clone git@github.com:username/NiagraST-GUI-Query-Assembler.git

Start coding!

Make sure to commit regularly.  To do so...

git status  - this will tell you what files aren't being tracked, or which are being tracked but have changed

git add <filename, or wildcard pattern> - this will tell the git repo to add these files to the next commit

git commit -m "Messages go here"  -  This will commit your changes and create a piece of history in the repository.  Make sure your message describes what you're committing, and make sure your commits aren't too big!  COMMIT AND COMMIT OFTEN!

When you've done some work and want to share it with the rest of us, use...

git push origin
